Hi there, welcome to my blog! I tend to prefer talking about things rather than myself, so here's a very short snippet on my background and interests.

**Background**

I am one of those lucky individuals who has lived across different European nations in my lifetime. I moved to London to study Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College and I would be lying if I didn't say this experience didn't shape my adult mentality. Since graduating, I've worked in the field of medical devices as an embedded software engineer. 

**Interests**

Even though my strength is in firmware, I retain a spark of enthusiasm and interest for digital signal processing, especially with regards to human or biological data (e.g. biosignals). Even though I do quite a bit of data analysis at work, I've been practicing with certain libraries of Python on my own, as a way to get a bit closer to open-source analysis of interesting data.

On the other end of the scale, because of my exposure to Bluetooth and WiFi comms in medical devices, I've also picked up an interest for the back-end of web applications (server frameworks, databases and cloud computing). It's not an area I'm particularly keen to profesionally work in, but I do think it's important to know about it, so a lot of my posts approach it.

Lastly, I'm ever more conscious about the importance of data security and reliability, and again, this is something a lot of my writing covers because I'm learning and writing as I go.

**Questions or feedback?**
Get in touch through the contact forms, I would love to get any feedback on my writing, and on my coding too! Equally, if you've found any of the articles particularly helpful it would be great to hear from you :)
